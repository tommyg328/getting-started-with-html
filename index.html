<h1>Things to Know</h1>

<b>The Web</b>

<p>The web is is made of many different components, first of which is us, the user.  We type in commands on our computer which<br>
get sent over the internet from our web browsers to servers using <em>HTTP</em>.  The servers interperet the commands and respond<br>
accordingly.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML is the basis for everything on the web and stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language.</em> HTML constist of:</p>

<p><em>Text Content</em> - Everything you see<br>
<em>Markup</em> - What it looks like<br>
<em>References</em> - to other documents like images and videos<br>
<em>Links to other pages</em> - Links are referred to as URLs.  Clicking on links, moving deeper into web content is why its called<br>
the <em><b>Web</b>.</em>  
</p>
<b>HTML Markup</b>
<p><em>HTML Markup</em> is what the content looks like.  Markup consist of <em>Tags</em> and  <em>Attributes</em> <br>
defined within an <em>Element.</em></p>
<p>An Element contains of an opening tag, a closing tag, and content inbetween the two tags.<br>
  If a tag has only an opening tag, but no closing tag, it is called a <em>Void Tag.</em>
  </p>
<p>Attributes are also part of an element, so also contained inside a tag.  Attributes will point to a value.<br>
Here is an example of an attribute:</p>

< a href = "web address" > content link < /a>, where HREF is the attribute and the web address is the value
</p>
<b>Inline vs Block</b>
<p> <em>Inline Elements</em> will exist on one line and next line without spacing, like this example:<br>
This is an inline element<br>
This is also an inline element
  </p>

<p><em>Block Elements</em> have a defined space around them that can be made larger or smaller.  Here is an example:<br></p>

<p>This is a block element</p>
<p>This is also a block element</p>
